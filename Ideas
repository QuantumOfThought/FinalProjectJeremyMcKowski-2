I want to do the following  i want to monior traffic to and from a Uqibquiti Dream Machine router
I cant do a real api so I want faker to be used to generate the fake traffic

this will be a streamlit app 

here was my original idea
The Concept of What I am Doing and the Need

• Home networks now contain numerous IoT devices that communicate with external 
servers without user visibility. After viewing Ubiquiti's dashboard, is useful but 
overly complex for what I want to accomplish. It can be a touch overwhelming and 
broad in scope where I simply need a basic dashboard of devices connected to the 
network and a simple overview of the type of traffic and how much each device is
sending or receiving for basic security awareness. This project creates a simplified 
monitoring dashboard that shows device connection patterns and transmit/receive 
information in an easy-to-read format. 
The API I Have Chosen and Why

• The Ubiquiti Site Manager API provides access to network device data and traffic 
metrics from my Dream Router 7. This API offers device connection tracking, traffic 
flow analysis, and filtering by SSID, which aligns with project requirements. The 
practical advantage is working with existing hardware that has a standard 
dashboard I can work against to custom build a “better” dashboard. 
• The API's JSON format and rate limiting support sustained monitoring applications.
The Framework I Have Chosen and Why

• After seeing the other frameworks in class, I assess that Streamlit provides the best 
dashboard development with built-in data visualization components and real-time 
data handling. Its foundational architecture ensures seems like a simple way to 
build a webapp that is lightweight, but able to display the information in a 
selectable manner. After seeing the class example, it feels like a better lighter 
weight choice and has some niceties built in like the mapping integration 
capabilities enable geographic analysis and visualization of external IP destinations, 
accessible drop-down menus, selection boxes, and real time response to ongoing 
information feels like the best fit. I also honestly liked how it looked in class. 
Project Plan

• Phase One: Establish API connectivity and basic device discovery. 
• Phase Two: Develop connection tracking and CSV logging for historical analysis. 
• Phase Three: Build the Streamlit dashboard with simplified device displays and 
connection visualizations. 
• Phase Four: Add geographic mapping of external destinations and protocol analysis. 
• Phase Five: Implement alerting for suspicious behavior, testing, and 
documentation.

I want to add accuweather as a widget as well I have an API key we can use later but for now review and lets get faker started for the traffic -- comment everything in steps so I can follow along
